/**
   \mainpage JACUI - Just Another C++ User Interface Library

   \section intro Introduction

   JACUI is intended to be a simple, lightweight, cross-platform,
   "modern" C++ user interface library.  

   When it's finished, I mean.

   Currently, it's just a simple C++ wrapper for the SDL (Simple
   Directmedia Layer) on Linux and Windows.

   \section install Installation

   To compile JACUI, SDL 1.2 and compatible versions of SDL_image and
   SDL_ttf are required.  You can download these from

    http://www.libsdl.org

    \subsection install_linux Installation on GNU/Linux Systems

    To compile and install JACUI on Linux and possibly other UN*X
    platforms, run

    \code
    ./configure
    make
    make install
    \endcode

    JACUI expects SDL header files in /usr/include/SDL and SDL
    libraries in /usr/lib, as is the case on Debian-based
    distributions.  You can override this providing the
    --with-sdl-include-path and --with-sdl-lib-path options to
    configure.

    \subsection install_win32 Installation on MS Windows Systems
    
    To compile JACUI on MS Windows platform, Visual Studio 2010 is
    recommended.  Download and extract the Win32 SDL*-devel-*-VC.zip
    from www.libsdl.org, and edit the UserMacros section in
    sdl1.2.props to reflect the path to your SDL installation.  After
    that, open the VS 2010 solution file jacui.sln and hit F7 to
    build the static library and the examples.

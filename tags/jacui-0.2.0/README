JACUI - Just Another C++ User Interface Library

JACUI is intended to be a simple, lightweight, cross-platform,
"modern" C++ user interface library.  When it's finished, I mean.
Currently, it's just a simple C++ wrapper for the SDL (Simple
Directmedia Layer) on Linux and Windows.

To compile JACUI, SDL version 1.2 and compatible versions of SDL_image
and SDL_ttf are required.  You can download these from 

    http://www.libsdl.org

To compile and install JACUI on Linux and possibly other UN*X
platforms, run the (hopefully) already familiar stanza of

    ./configure
    make
    make install

JACUI expects SDL header files in /usr/include/SDL and SDL libraries
in /usr/lib, as is the case on Debian-based distributions.  You can
override this providing the --with-sdl-include-path and
--with-sdl-lib-path options to configure.

To compile JACUI on MS Windows platform, Visual Studio 2010 is
recommended.  Download and extract the Win32 SDL*-devel-*-VC.zip from
www.libsdl.org, and edit the UserMacros section in sdl1.2.props to
reflect the path to your SDL installation.  After that, open the
VS2010 solution file (jacui.sln) and hit F7 to compile.

For information on how to use JACUI, see the example programs in the
src/exaples directory, or the Doxygen documentation in docs/html.
